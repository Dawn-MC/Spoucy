Brother gained access to my account, I'm not actually abandoning this. Shouldn't happen again, sorry. :/

Spoucy is a Minecraft mod made by Paint_Ninja and some voluntary contributors. It allows the server to give the client custom textures for new blocks and textures without touching existing ones. It is fully compatible with other Forge mods and is inspired by Spoutcraft.
